## `Contributing`

Contributions are always welcome!

If there's any spelling mistakes/wrong links/visual issues, please open an issue! Even better if you know how to fix the issue! (You can create a fork, fix the issue and pull request it)

Also, please check [`wishlist.html`](https://yetiuard.github.io/wishlist) if you want to help include features I haven't been able to impement.
